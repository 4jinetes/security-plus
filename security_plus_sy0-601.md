# 1.0 Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities

## Types of social engineering techniques

### Phishing

_Phishing_ is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a user into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.

Most of this attacks use _Spoofing_ techniques. Spoofing is the act of disguising a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. Spoofing can apply to emails, phone calls, and websites, or can be more technical, such as a computer spoofing an IP address, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), or Domain Name System (DNS) server.

Some of the techniques used do disguise users are:

* __Typosquatting__: Typosquatting, also known as URL hijacking, is a form of cybersquatting (sitting on sites under someone else's brand or copyright) that misspell a website address (e.g., "gooogle.com" instead of "google.com") and, usually hosts an alternative website owned by a hacker imitating the look and feel of the original one.

* __Prepending__: It is a type or typosquatting where an attacker attaches something as a prefix to a URL (e.g., "ggoogle.com" instead of "google.com").

* __Pretexting__: Pretexting is a form of social engineering in which an attacker tries to convince a user to give up valuable information or access to a service or system. The distinguishing feature of this kind of attack is that the scam artists comes up with a story - or pretext - in order to fool the user.

#### Types of phishing attacks

* __Smishing__: A form of phishing when someone tries to trick users into giving them their private information via a text or SMS message.

* __Vishing__: Vishing is the phone's version of email phishing and uses automated voice messages to steal confidential information. Vishing attacks use a spoofed caller ID to disguise as a legitimate number.

* __Pharming__: Pharming ("farming" + "phishing") is a kind of social engineering cyberattack in which criminals redirect internet users trying to reach a specific website to a different, fake site. Pharming typically works by installing malicious code on either a user's machine or a DNS server, which then misdirects users to fraudulent websites without their knowledge or consent. The first method works on an individual level. It alters the hosts file on a victim's computer, which causes internet traffic from that computer to go to a fake website instead of the desired one. The second works on a broader level by poisoning a DNS server to redirect multiple users to the fake site.

* __Spear phishing__: Spear phishing is an email or electronic communications scam targeted towards a specific individual, organization or business. To be effective, attackers perform some previous information gathering on the victim, known as __*Reconnaissance*__. The information can be gathered from open sources like lead generation websites, Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook or Instagram or, corporate websites. Based on this information, attackers can build a believable pretext using information such as where you work, where you bank, recent finantial transactions and family or friends. If the spear phishing attempt targets executives (e.g., CEO or CFO) is called _whaling_.
