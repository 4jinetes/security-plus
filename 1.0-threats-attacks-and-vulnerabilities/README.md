# 1.0 Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities

## 1.1 Compare and contrast different types of social engineering techniques.

### Phishing

_Phishing_ is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a user into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.

Most of this attacks use _Spoofing_ techniques. Spoofing is the act of disguising a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. Spoofing can apply to emails, phone calls, and websites, or can be more technical, such as a computer spoofing an IP address, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), or Domain Name System (DNS) server.

Some of the techniques used do disguise users are:

* __Typosquatting__: Typosquatting, also known as URL hijacking, is a form of cybersquatting (sitting on sites under someone else's brand or copyright) that misspell a website address (e.g., "gooogle.com" instead of "google.com") and, usually hosts an alternative website owned by a hacker imitating the look and feel of the original one.

* __Prepending__: It is a type or typosquatting where an attacker attaches something as a prefix to a URL (e.g., "ggoogle.com" instead of "google.com").

* __Pretexting__: Pretexting is a form of social engineering in which an attacker tries to convince a user to give up valuable information or access to a service or system. The distinguishing feature of this kind of attack is that the scam artists comes up with a story - or pretext - in order to fool the user.

#### Types of phishing attacks

* __Smishing__: A form of phishing when someone tries to trick users into giving them their private information via a text or SMS message.

* __Vishing__: Vishing is the phone's version of email phishing and uses automated voice messages to steal confidential information. Vishing attacks use a spoofed caller ID to disguise as a legitimate number.

* __Pharming__: Pharming ("farming" + "phishing") is a kind of social engineering cyberattack in which criminals redirect internet users trying to reach a specific website to a different, fake site. Pharming typically works by installing malicious code on either a user's machine or a DNS server, which then misdirects users to fraudulent websites without their knowledge or consent. The first method works on an individual level. It alters the hosts file on a victim's computer, which causes internet traffic from that computer to go to a fake website instead of the desired one. The second works on a broader level by poisoning a DNS server to redirect multiple users to the fake site.

* __Spear phishing__: Spear phishing is an email or electronic communications scam targeted towards a specific individual, organization or business. To be effective, attackers perform some previous information gathering on the victim, known as __*Reconnaissance*__. The information can be gathered from open sources like lead generation websites, Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook or Instagram or, corporate websites. Based on this information, attackers can build a believable pretext using information such as where you work, where you bank, recent financial transactions and family or friends. If the spear phishing attempt targets executives (e.g., CEO or CFO) is called _whaling_.

### Impersonation

_Impersonation_ (pretending to be someone else) is one of the basic social
engineering techniques. The classic impersonation attack is for the social
engineer to phone into a department, claim they have to adjust something on
the user's system remotely, and get the user to reveal their password. For these types of attacks to succeed the approach must be convincing and persuasive. This is linked with the _pretexting_.

The amount and accuracy of the information gathered during _Reconnaissance_ is key to run these types of attacks successfully. Once attackers gain the trust of the victim they proceed to extract information, __*eliciting information*__ without the victim realising this is happening. Things like email addressed or passwords. Attackers use well-documented psychological techniques to play the victim.

This extraction of information can be used for *__Identity fraud__*. Identity fraud is the use by one person of another person's personal information, without authorization, to commit a crime or to deceive or defraud that other person or a third person. Some examples are:

  * Credit card fraud: Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of a credit or debit card, or similar payment tool (ACH, EFT, recurring charge, etc.), to fraudulently obtain money or property.
    
  * Bank fraud: Bank fraud is the use of potentially illegal means to obtain money, assets, or other property owned or held by a financial institution, or to obtain money from depositors by fraudulently posing as a bank or other financial institution.
    
  * Loan fraud: Loan fraud is when your information is used to request a loan or a lease.
    
  * Government benefits fraud: Government benefits fraud is when attacker obtain benefits on your behalf. 

#### Protecting against impersonation

Some basic precautions can be taking to try to prevent impersonation:

* Never volunteer information, e.g., passwords.
* Do not disclose personal details.
* Always verify before revealing information. Call back companies and verify through 3rd parties.
* Always encourage verification.

### Dumpster diving

Dumpster diving is a technique used to retrieve information that could be used to carry out an attack on a computer network. Dumpster diving is not limited to searching through the trash for obvious treasures like access codes or passwords written down on sticky notes. The main purpose is to collect information that can ba used later for different attacks.

There are some simple ways, specially , companies can use to secure their garbage:

* Secure it with a fence and a lock.
* Shred your documents or even burn them.
* Check your disposal policies making sure you are disposing properly confidential information. Use external companies if necessary.

### Shoulder surfing

Shoulder surfing is a criminal practice where thieves steal your personal data by spying over your shoulder as you use a laptop, ATM, public kiosk or other electronic device in public. Despite the funny name, it is a security risk that can cause a financial wipeout.

Some ways to prevent it are:

* Be aware of your surroundings when introducing sensitive information.
* User privacy filters. Used on a screen, they block the view of the screen unless you are sitting directly in front of it.
* Keep your monitors out of sight, away from windows or hallways.

### Hoax

A hoax is a falsehood deliberately fabricated to masquerade as the truth. It seems that it could be real, but it does not exit. In the ambit of security, hoaxes are false reports about non-existent threats or situations. It is design, if credible enough, to divert resources and trigger actions, sometimes drastic such as shutting down a network.

Typically, the warning arrives in an email note or is distributed through a note in a company's internal network but, it can arrive through other channels like Facebook or Linkedin walls or tweets.

Other hoaxes are just design to simply take your money, even, not through electronic means. An example will be the request of gift cards.

Some advice to prevent fall for a hoax are:

* Do not believe anything on the Internet, contrast and check the information.
* Perform cross-references on specialised webs.
* Spam filters can help.
* In general, common sense. If it sounds too good to be true, double check.

### Watering hole attack

A watering hole attack works by identifying a website that's frequented by users within a targeted organisation, or even an entire sector, such as defence, government or healthcare. That website is then compromised to enable the distribution of malware.

The attacker identifies weaknesses in the main target's cyber-security, then manipulates the watering hole site to deliver malware that will exploit these weaknesses.

Some basic points to try to prevent this kind of attacks are:

* Defense-in-depth. A layered defense never based on just one thing.
* Firewalls and IPS. To stop traffic before things get bad.
* anti-virus / Anti-malware signature updates/
