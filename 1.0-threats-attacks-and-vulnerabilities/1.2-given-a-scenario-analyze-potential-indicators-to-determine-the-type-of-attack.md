## An overview of malware

Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware. Shorthand for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network. 

Since its birth more than 30 years ago, malware has found several methods of attack. Malware is typically delivered in the form of a link or file over email and requires the user to click on the link or open the file to execute the malware taking advantage of an exiting vulnerability. In addition, they include email attachments, malicious advertisements on popular sites (malvertising), fake software installations, infected USB drives, infected apps, phishing emails and even text messages.
