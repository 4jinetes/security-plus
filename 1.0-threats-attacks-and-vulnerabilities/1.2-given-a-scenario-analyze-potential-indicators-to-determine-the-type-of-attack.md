# An overview of malware

Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware. Shorthand for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network. 

Since its birth more than 30 years ago, malware has found several methods of attack. Malware is typically delivered in the form of a link or file over email and requires the user to click on the link or open the file to execute the malware taking advantage of an exiting vulnerability. In addition, they include email attachments, malicious advertisements on popular sites (malvertising), fake software installations, infected USB drives, infected apps, phishing emails and even text messages.

## Types of malware

### Virus

Computer viruses are a type of malware that earned their name because of how they spread by "infecting" other files on a disk or computer. Viruses then spread to other disk drives and machines when the infected files are received in downloads from websites, email attachments, shared drives or when carried in files on physical media, such as USB drives or - in the early days - floppy disks. Viruses need the user to execute, this is why they attach to legitime programs.

#### Virus types

* __Program virus__: Malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code.

* __Boot sector virus__: A boot sector virus is a type of virus that infects the boot sector of floppy disks or the Master Boot Record (MBR) of hard disks (some infect the boot sector of the hard disk instead of the MBR).

* __Script virus__: A script virus is any type of malicious code that is executed after a user visits a page that has advertisements, files or code running in the background that contains the malicious code.

* __Macro virus__: A macro virus is a computer virus written in the same macro language used for software applications, such as word processors. Microsoft Word and Excel are two examples of applications that feature powerful macro languages, which are embedded in documents so they run automatically when the documents are open. A macro virus subsequently releases a chain of events in conjunction with the application.

* __Fileless virus__: Fileless malware is a type of malicious software that does not rely on virus-laden files to infect a host. Instead, it exploits applications that are commonly used for legitimate and justified activity to execute malicious code in resident memory.

Appropriately updated with the last signatures can help stop virus from infect the systems.

### Worms

A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage.

Firewalls, IDS or IPS can mitigate many work infection avoiding the spread of them.

### Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents you from accessing your computer (or the data that is stored on it). The computer itself may become locked, or the data on it might be stolen, deleted or encrypted.

Usually users are asked to contact the attacker via an anonymous email address or follow instructions on an anonymous web page, to make payment. The payment is invariably demanded in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, in order to unlock your computer, or access your data. However, even if you pay the ransom, there is no guarantee that you will get access to your computer, or your files.

One recent version of rasomware is *__crypto malware__* or *__crypto ransomware__* is one of the recent forms of malware that attacks a computer by restricting the user's access to files stored in the computer. The malware displays an on-screen alert advising the user to pay a given amount of money through anonymous methods such as Bitcoin, to regain access to his or her files.

One way to protect against ransomware is to keep a backuk of your data, keep your system and applications up to date and, keep you anti-virus or anti-malware up to date with the latest signatures.

### Trojan

A trojan horse, or trojan, is a type of malicious code or software that looks legitimate but can take control of your computer. A trojan is designed to damage, disrupt, steal, or in general inflict some other harmful action on your data or network.

A trojan acts like a bona fide application or file to trick you. It seeks to deceive you into loading and executing the malware on your device. Once installed, a trojan can perform the action it was designed for.

Multiple times this action is to download other software to your e.g., potentially unwanted programs (PUPs). Potentially unwanted programs are programs that does not need to be malicious but it is not desirable an it may cause problems in your computer e.g., a browser tool bar.

On a trojan has access to a system a very common action is to install a *__backdoor__* into the systems. A backdoor is a malware that provides a non-convencional method by which authorized and unauthorized users are able to get around normal security measures and gain high level user access (aka root access) on a computer system, network or software application.

A specific type of backdoor are *__remote access trojans__*. A remote access trojan (RAT) is a malware program that includes a back door for administrative control over the target computer. RATs are usually downloaded invisibly with a user-requested program - such as a game - or sent as an email attachment.

Once a remote access trojan has infiltrated a computer, the cybercriminal can gain remote access, monitoring or even controlling the device or the network. And once they have this access, there is no limit to what the cybercriminal can do; they have complete, anonymous control.

Prevention of trojan infectation follow similar guidelines than any other malware.

### Rootkit

Rootkits are a type of malware that are designed so that they can remain hidden on your computer. But while you might not notice them, they are active. Rootkits give cybercriminals the ability to remotely control your computer.

Rootkits can contain a number of tools, ranging from programs that allow hackers to steal your passwords to modules that make it easy for them to steal your credit card or online banking information. Rootkits can also give hackers the ability to subvert or disable security software and track the keys you tap on your keyword, making it easy for criminals to steal your personal information.

Because rootkits can hijack or subvert security software, they are especially hard to detect, making it likely that this type of malware could live on your computer for a long time causing significant damage. Sometimes the only way to completely eliminate a well-hidden rootkit is to erase your computer’s operating system and rebuild from scratch.

#### Types of rootkits

* __Hardware or firmware rootkit__: The name of this type of rootkit comes from where it is installed on your computer. This type of malware could infect your computer’s hard drive or its system BIOS, the software that is installed on a small memory chip in your computer’s motherboard. It can even infect your router. Hackers can use these rootkits to intercept data written on the disk.

* __Bootloader rootkit__: Your computer’s bootloader is an important tool. It loads your computer’s operating system when you turn the machine on. A bootloader toolkit, then, attacks this system, replacing your computer’s legitimate bootloader with a hacked one. This means that this rootkit is activated even before your computer’s operating system turns on.

* __Memory rootkit__: This type of rootkit hides in your computer’s RAM, or Random Access Memory. These rootkits will carry out harmful activities in the background. The good news? These rootkits have a short lifespan. They only live in your computer’s RAM and will disappear once you reboot your system — though sometimes further work is required to get rid of them.

* __Application rootkit__: Application rootkits replace standard files in your computer with rootkit files. They might also change the way standard applications work. These rootkits might infect programs such as Word, Paint, or Notepad. Every time you run these programs, you will give hackers access to your computer. The challenge here is that the infected programs will still run normally, making it difficult for users to detect the rootkit.

* __Kernel mode rootkits__: These rootkits target the core of your computer’s operating system. Cybercriminals can use these to change how your operating system functions. They just need to add their own code to it. This can give them easy access to your computer and make it easy for them to steal your personal information.

Rootkits due to its nature are very difficult to find and remove. Some general advice is:

* Look for unusual processes running.
* Use a remover specific to the rootkit.
* Secure boot with UEFI, that it is security implemented in the BIOS.

### Adware

Adware, or advertising supported software, is software that displays unwanted advertisements on your computer. Adware programs will tend to serve you pop-up ads, can change your browser’s homepage, add spyware and just bombard your device with advertisements. Adware is a more succinct name for potentially unwanted programs. It is not quite a virus and it may not be as obviously malicious as a lot of other problematic code floating around on the Internet.

### Spyware

Spyware is unwanted software that infiltrates your computing device, stealing your internet usage data and sensitive information. Spyware is classified as a type of malware - malicious software designed to gain access to or damage your computer, often without your knowledge.

### Bots and Botnets

A botnet is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which is running one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection.

Botnet owners can have access to several thousand computers at a time and can command them to carry out malicious activities. Cybercriminals initially gain access to these devices by using special Trojan viruses to attack the computers’ security systems, before implementing *__command and control__* software to enable them to carry out malicious activities on a large scale. These activities can be automated to encourage as many simultaneous attacks as possible.

Some recommendations to protect against botnet attacks are:

* Use a Firewall
* Update your software and systems to the latest version
* Get protection that works at DNS-level
* Manage admin rights in your organization

### Logic bombs

A logic bomb is a sinister piece of code that is secretly inserted into a computer network, operating system, or a software application. Like any other malicious code, its primary goal is to wreak havoc on your system – steal or corrupt your data, crash or overtake your device, or completely wipe your hard drive.

However, the main difference between a logic bomb and other malicious software is that the former can lie dormant for years. It is designed to execute its code only when certain conditions are met. For example, after a specified date and time, when a specific file is opened, or when it is deleted.

### Keylogger

Keyloggers are a type of monitoring software designed to record keystrokes made by a user. One of the oldest forms of cyber threat, these keystroke loggers record the information you type into a website or application and send to back to a third party.
